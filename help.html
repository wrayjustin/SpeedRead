      <h3 id="scoring-types">Scoring Types</h3>
      <p>SpeedRead contains three scoring modes, providing different methods for incentivizing accurate and timely
        answers. The “Game Score Type” can be changed at any time and will automatically update the relevant score
        displays.</p>
      <h4 id="plus-minus">Plus-Minus</h4>
      <p>One point is earned for every correct answer, and one point is lost for every skipped word. <em>[This is the
          default scoring mode.]</em></p>
      <h4 id="total-stars">Total Stars</h4>
      <p>The score is based on stars earned by speed, up to five stars per correct answer. No score reductions for
        skipped words. <em>[Friendly Mode]</em></p>
      <h4 id="time-based">Time-Based</h4>
      <p>Scoring is based on speed, with points added for correct answers and deducted for skipped words. The points
        awarded, or subtracted, are based on the maximum number of seconds spent up to the time limit set.
        <em>[Competitive Mode]</em>
      </p>
      <h3 id="game-settings">Game Settings</h3>
      <p>SpeedRead allows for the customization of various game settings. The following settings are customizable:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Action</th>
            <th>Key</th>
            <th>Default</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>

            <td>Plus-Minus</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Round Time Limit</td>
            <td>Time before the word is skipped automatically. Also used as the basis for time warnings.</td>
            <td>30</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Max Stars Per Round</td>
            <td>Maximum amount of stars earned per round; used as the basis for stars awarded for a correct answer.</td>
            <td>5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Custom Game Wordlist</td>
            <td>(<em>See <a href="#custom-wordlists">Custom Wordlists</a></em>)</td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Custom State Data</td>
            <td>(<em>See <a href="#game-save-data">Game Save Data</a></em>)</td>
            <td>–</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Advanced Settings</td>
            <td>(<em>See <a href="#game-save-data">Game Save Data</a></em>)</td>
            <td>–</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Saved changes to these settings will take effect immediately and automatically update relevant statistics.</p>
      <h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
      <p>To provide for quick and easy proctoring, the game supports keyboard shortcuts to navigate. The supported
        keyboard shortcuts are as follows:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Action</th>
            <th>Key</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Pause/Resume</td>
            <td><em>Space Bar</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Correct Answer</td>
            <td><em>Right Arrow</em></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Skip Word</td>
            <td><em>Left Arrow</em></td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h3 id="game-save-data">Game Save Data</h3>
      <p>Game Data can be saved from the “Game Settings” screen. Save data is provided in both text form and a sharable
        URL. The text version can be copied, stored, and then later pasted into the Save Data field to resume a game.
        The URL is a link that automatically continues the game and can be shared.</p>
      <p>Additionally, various game saves can be merged (combined) to create cumulative games. Joining games can be
        useful for combining games when one was not resumed or building long-term statistics (across sessions). Merging
        saves can be found under the “Advanced Settings” option of the “Game Settings” screen.</p>
      <h4 id="to-save">To Save</h4>
      <p>Copy and Store (in a file, etc.) the “Game State Data” content from the “Game Settings” dialog. Alternatively,
        you can save the Game Data URL (right-click the link icon and select your browser’s link-copy option).</p>
      <h4 id="to-resume">To Resume</h4>
      <p>Paste previously saved data into the “Game State Data” field of the “Game Settings” screen, and click “Save.”
        Alternatively, click the previously saved Game Data URL (or paste it into your browser’s address bar).</p>
      <h4 id="to-merge">To Merge</h4>
      <p>Click and expand the “Advanced Settings” under, and enter one saved game (the desired “Game State Data”) into
        “Game Save #1” and the other into “Game Save #2.” You can only merge two games at a time, but you can run the
        operation multiple times. Click “Merge Data.” The combined game will be loaded, and you can save the new data
        through the traditional methods.</p>
      <h3 id="requirments">Requirments</h3>
      <p>SpeedRead is a single file that can be played (and stored) entirely offline. However, it requires some
        third-party dependencies and an initial internet connection when first loaded. Additionally, the browser must
        support ~2015-level features and functionality; use a new(ish) browser version for best results.</p>
      <p>SpeedRead should support (and has limited testing on):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google Chrome/Chromium (Version 49+)</li>
        <li>Microsoft Edge (Version 12+)</li>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox (Desktop Version 36+ / Mobile Version 49+)</li>
        <li>Apple Safari (Desktop Version 10+ / iOS Version 10+)</li>
        <li>Amazon Silk (Version 49+ | Fire Table, Fire TV, Echo Show)</li>
        <li>Samsung Internet Browser (Version 49+)</li>
        <li>Opera (Desktop Version 36+ / Mobile Version 64+ / All Mini Versions / Mobile 3+)</li>
        <li>UCWeb UC Android (Version 11+)</li>
        <li>Tencent QQ Browser (Version 10+)</li>
        <li>Badiu Browser (Version 7+)</li>
        <li>KaiOS Browser (Version 2+)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Third-Party Resources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CDN (<a href="http://cdn.jsdelivr.net">cdn.jsdelivr.net</a>)</li>
        <li>CSS (<a href="http://stackedit.io">stackedit.io</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>SpeedRead may work on older versions of the above or other alternative browsers (primarily if they are based on
        one of the above). However, testing has not been conducted on other browsers. Please submit an issue if
        compatibility issues are discovered.</p>
      <p>SpeedRead has also been tested via “Casting” from mobile and desktop applications to TV screens, via Chrome
        Casting, AirPlay, etc.</p>
      <h3 id="custom-wordlists">Custom Wordlists</h3>
      <p>SpeedRead allows for custom wordlists to be defined. All wordlists must be comma seperated and may only contain
        alphanumeric, hyphens, spaces, and apostrophes.</p>
      <p>Updates to the custom wordlist are applied immediately upon the settings save.</p>
      <h3 id="other-uses">Other Uses</h3>
      <p>Although SpeedRead was designed for those just learning to read English, and to study “Sight Words” in
        particular, the flexibility of Custom Wordlists allows for a wider range of usage.</p>
      <p>SpeedRead requires a “proctor,” but this <em>“limitation”</em> enables additional use cases for those who can
        already read. In such a case, SpeedRead acts as a “flash card” application. The content added to the word list
        can include text used by the learner to initiate some form of recall (memorization).</p>
      <p>Additionally, SpeedRead can be useful, for any age, for learning a non-native language. Such language learning
        can be useful for both reading and pronunciation.</p>
      <p>Example Alternative Uses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Memorizing/Reciting/Studying Data and Facts
          <ul>
            <li>Laws</li>
            <li>Bible Verses</li>
            <li>Technical Terms / Figures</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Proctored Flash Cards / Studying</li>
        <li>Non-Native Reading</li>
        <li>Non-Native Pronunciation</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Note</em>: SpeedRead allows only alphanumeric (and hyphens, spaces, and apostrophes) entries in the
        wordlist - no special characters are allowed (excluding space). (<em>See <a href="#custom-wordlists">Custom
            Wordlists</a></em>)</p>
      <h2 id="development">Development</h2>
      <p>SpeedRead is a prime example of a quick idea turning into a weekend project. This project is also a great
        representation of “feature creep.” What started as a quick “app,” in less than a few dozen lines of code, turned
        into a featured-filled game. Feedback from players and proctors resulted in numerous features rapidly added over
        a weekend (game saves, different scoring modes, etc.). As a result, although no bugs are currently known, the
        overall code quality is definitively “hacky.”</p>
      <p>The application is built using the following technologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS3</li>
        <li>Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)</li>
        <li>Bootstrap (5.2)</li>
        <li>LZString (1.4)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="license--rights">License &amp; Rights</h2>
      <p>You are free to play the game (including in a classroom setting). You may store an unmodified copy for offline
        play. All other rights are reserved.</p>
